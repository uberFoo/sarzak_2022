/// External Type
///
/// This may literally be anything. It's used during code generation to generate variables names
/// and type names for things that are outside of a modeled domain. For example, a timer would
/// be an external type. The specifics of how it is used is up to the model compiler.
///
/// In grace, the `name` attribute is used during code generation to create variable names by
/// converting it to `snake_case`. When used as a type, it is converted to `UpperCamelCase`
///.
///
/// We use `path` as the path is a `use` statement.
///
/// I'm updating this while trying to use it, so this description is going to be rather incoherent
/// until things settle down.
///
/// The way I'm using this, and hopefully the way that will always accommodate, is as a singleton
/// within a particular function scope. Maybe it's a system-wide singleton? I dunno. But it's
/// a singleton.
